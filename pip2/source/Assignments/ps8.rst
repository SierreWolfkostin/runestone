#. Problem set

   * Starting this week, the problem sets will be distributed and turned in via cTools.
   * This week, there is a file called ps7.py. You should download a copy of it. You will edit it on your laptop or workstation and test it by running it using your native Python interpreter.
   * You will also need to download a file called test.py. It contains the testEqual function that gives you feedback on whether you have correctly implemented various things in the problem set.
