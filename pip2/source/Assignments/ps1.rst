Problem Set
-----------
**Due:** **Sunday, September 7th at 5 pm**

**Instructions:** Write the code you want to save in the provided boxes, and click **save** for each one. The last code you have saved for each one by the deadline is what will be graded.

  .. tabbed:: ps1_pb1

    .. tab:: Problem

      1. The variable ``tpa`` currently has the value ``0``. Assign the variable ``tpa`` the value ``6`` .

      .. activecode:: ps_1_1

         tpa = 0
         
         ====
         import test
         print "\n\n---\n"
         test.testEqual(tpa, 6)

    .. tab:: Solution

      .. activecode:: ps_1_1s

         tpa = 0 # just reassigning this to 6 is also fine
         tpa = 6

         ====
         import test
         print "\n\n---\n"
         test.testEqual(tpa, 6)


2. Write code to assign the variable ``yb`` to have the same value that variable ``cw`` has. Do not change the first line of code (``cw = "Hello"``), but write code that would work no matter what the current value of ``cw`` is.


  .. tabbed:: ps1_pb2

    .. tab:: Problem

      .. activecode:: ps_1_2

         cw = "Hello"
         yb = 0

         ====
         import test
         print "\n\n---\n"
         test.testEqual(cw, yb)

    .. tab:: Solution

      .. activecode:: ps_1_2s

         cw = "Hello"
         yb = 0
         yb = cw

         ====
         import test
         print "\n\n---\n"
         test.testEqual(cw, yb)


3. Write code to print out the type of the variable ``apples_and_oranges``, the type of the variable ``abc``, and the type of the variable ``new_var``.

  .. tabbed:: ps1_pb3

    .. tab:: Problem

      .. activecode:: ps_1_3
         
         apples_and_oranges = """hello, everybody
                                   how're you?"""

         abc = 6.75483

         new_var = 824

         ====
         print "\n\n---\n(There are no tests for this problem.)"

    .. tab:: Solution

      .. activecode:: ps_1_3s
         
         apples_and_oranges = """hello, everybody
                                   how're you?"""

         abc = 6.75483

         new_var = 824

         print type(apples_and_oranges)
         print type(abc)
         print type(new_var)

         ====
         print "\n\n---\n(There are no tests for this problem.)"


4. There is a function we are giving you called ``square``. It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. Write code to assign a variable callex ``xyz`` the value ``5*5`` (five squared). Use the square function, rather than just multiplying with ``*``.

.. tabbed:: ps1_pb4

  .. tab:: Problem

    .. activecode:: ps_1_4
       :include: addl_functions

       # Want to make sure there really is a function called square? Uncomment the following line and press run.

       #print type(square)

       xyz = ""
       
       ====
       import test
       print "\n\n---\n"
       try:
          test.testEqual(type(xyz), type(3))
          test.testEqual(xyz,25)
       except:
          print "variable xyz doesn't have a value at all!"

  .. tab:: Solution

    .. activecode:: ps_1_4s
       :include: addl_functions

       # Want to make sure there really is a function called square? Uncomment the following line and press run.

       #print type(square)

       xyz = square(5)
       
       ====
       import test
       print "\n\n---\n"
       try:
          test.testEqual(type(xyz), type(3))
          test.testEqual(xyz,25)
       except:
          print "variable xyz doesn't have a value at all!"
      

5. Write code to assign the return value of the function call ``square(3)`` to the variable ``new_number``.

  .. tabbed:: ps1_pb5

    .. tab:: Problem

      .. activecode:: ps_1_5
          :include: addl_functions

          ====
          print "\n\n---\n"
          import test
          try:
             test.testEqual(new_number, 9)
          except:
             print "Failed test: the variable new_number does not exist yet"

    .. tab:: Solution

      .. activecode:: ps_1_5s
          :include: addl_functions

          new_number = square(3)

          ====
          print "\n\n---\n"
          import test
          try:
             test.testEqual(new_number, 9)
          except:
             print "Failed test: the variable new_number does not exist yet"


6. Write in a comment what each line of this code does. 

  .. tabbed:: ps1_pb6

    .. tab:: Problem

      .. activecode:: ps_1_6
          :include: addl_functions

          # Here's an example.
          xyz = 12 # The variable xyz is being assigned the value 12, which is an integer

          # Now do the same for these!
          a = 6

          b = a

          # make sure to be very clear and detailed about the following line of code
          orange = square(b)

          print a

          print b

          print orange

          pear = square

          print pear

    .. tab:: Solution

      .. activecode:: ps_1_6s
        :include: addl_functions

        # Here's an example.
        xyz = 12 # The variable xyz is being assigned the value 12, which is an integer

        # Now do the same for these!
        a = 6 # the variable a is being assigned the integer value 6

        b = a # the variable b is being assigned the value that the variable a holds

        # make sure to be very clear and detailed about the following line of code
        orange = square(b) # the variable orange is being assigned the value of the 
        ## evaluated expression square(b), which, if b is an integer, will be another integer

        print a # the (integer) value bound to/held by the variable a is printed

        print b # the (integer) value bound to the variable b is printed

        print orange # the (integer) value bound to the variable orange is printed

        pear = square # the variable pear is being assigned the value of the variable name square(which is a function)

        print pear # the value bound to the variable pear (now a function) is beign printed out 

        ## remember, print is for people! printing out is for the programmer/user to see, not the computer or the program!

7. There are a couple more functions we're giving you in this problem set. One is a function called ``greeting``, which takes any string and adds ``"Hello, "`` in front of it. (You can see examples in the code.) Another one is a function called ``random_digit``, which returns a value of any random integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). (You can also see examples in the code.)

Write code that assigns to the variable ``func_var`` the **function** ``greeting`` (without executing the function). 

Then, write code that assigns to the variable ``new_digit`` the **return value** from executing the function ``random_digit``.

Then, write code that assigns to the variable ``digit_func`` the **function** ``random_digit`` (without executing the function).

  .. tabbed:: ps1_pb7

    .. tab:: Problem

      .. activecode:: ps_1_7
         :include: addl_functions

         # For example
         print greeting("Jackie")
         print greeting("everybody")
         print greeting("sdgadgsal")
         
         # Try running all this code more than once, so you can see how calling the function
         # random_digit works.
         print random_digit()
         print random_digit()

         # Write code that assigns the variables as mentioned in the instructions.

         ====
         import test
         print "\n\n---\n"
         test.testEqual(type(func_var), type(greeting))
         test.testEqual(type(new_digit), type(1))
         test.testEqual(type(digit_func), type(random_digit))

    .. tab:: Solution

      .. activecode:: ps_1_7s
         :include: addl_functions

         # For example
         print greeting("Jackie")
         print greeting("everybody")
         print greeting("sdgadgsal")
         
         # Try running all this code more than once, so you can see how calling the function
         # random_digit works.
         print random_digit()
         print random_digit()

         # Write code that assigns the variables as mentioned in the instructions.
         func_var = greeting
         new_digit = random_digit()
         digit_func = random_digit

         ====
         import test
         print "\n\n---\n"
         test.testEqual(type(func_var), type(greeting))
         test.testEqual(type(new_digit), type(1))
         test.testEqual(type(digit_func), type(random_digit))


8. Now write code that assigns the variable ``newval`` to hold the **return value** of ``greeting("everyone in class")``.

  .. tabbed:: ps1_pb8

    .. tab:: Problem

      .. activecode:: ps_1_8
         :include: addl_functions

         ====   
         import test
         print "\n\n---\n"
         test.testEqual(newval, greeting("everyone in class"))

    .. tab:: Solution

      .. activecode:: ps_1_8s
         :include: addl_functions

         newval = greeting("everyone in class")

         ====   
         import test
         print "\n\n---\n"
         test.testEqual(newval, greeting("everyone in class"))
    

9. This code causes an error. Why? Write a comment explaining.

  .. tabbed:: ps1_pb9

    .. tab:: Problem

      .. activecode:: ps_1_9

         another_variable = "?!"
         b = another_variable()

    .. tab:: Solution

      .. activecode:: ps_1_9s

         another_variable = "?!"
         b = another_variable()
         # this code is trying to call a non-callable object
         # another_value holds a string value, not a function value, so that cannot be called like a function can be!

   
.. activecode:: addl_functions
   :nopre:
   :hidecode:

   def square(num):
      return num**2

   def greeting(st):
      #st = str(st) # just in case
      return "Hello, " + st

   def random_digit():
     import random
     return random.choice([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
