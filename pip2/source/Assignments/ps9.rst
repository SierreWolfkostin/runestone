Reading Response

.. _reading_response_8:

Answer the following questions. 

1. Briefly define open source software in your own words.

#. Weber argues that you should be surprised that there is high quality open source software out there and offers some questions/puzzles that he thinks need to be answered in ordered to explain how that has happened. Which of those questions do *you* think really are puzzling, and which, if any, do you think have obvious answers? 

#. Was there anything from this chapter you found confusing? If so, what?
