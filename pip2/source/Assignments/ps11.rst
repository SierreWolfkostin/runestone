Answer the following questions. 

1. The linux project uses git to organize the work of all the contributors. Take a look at the `linux project on github <https://github.com/torvalds/linux>`_. Take a look at the recent commits. Click around to see how many people have made contributions recently. Also check out the github page for `Runestone <https://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone>`_ and for `my fork of it <https://github.com/presnick/runestone>`_ to make this online textbook. Report on something interesting you found from exploring these public git repositories.

#. Brooks make an argument that communication complexity grows with the square of the number of people participating in a project. Why might that be true? And what are the things you could do in organizing a project to make it not be true?

#. What material from the chapter would you like to discuss in class?
